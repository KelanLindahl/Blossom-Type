# BlossomType

This is a typing test built with Javscript/HTML/CSS, inspired by my favorite colors as well as typings.gg! It's currently a WIP & I still have more to do before I can call it done :).

Want to check out the progress? please take a look at https://kelanlindahl.github.io/Blossom-Type/

Once the project is ready for a full release, I plan to rebuild it in React.
